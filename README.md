# GRay-CAD 2

Under heavy development
=======
GRay-CAD 2 is a program which can plot optical setups employing ABCD matrices.
It is also able to evaluate optical resonators (Bow-Tie, Fabry-Perot, triangle and rectangle) with an evolutionary algorithm. Especially the evaluation of elliptical eigenmodes is included, which makes GRAY-CAD 2 a powerful tool in your lab.
Another feature is the Modematching function. It allows to match an incomming beam, described by the beam waist, the rayleigh range and the waist position, to any output beam with the same wavelength with lenses. This algorithm uses the simulated annealing algorithm to evaluate the setups.
